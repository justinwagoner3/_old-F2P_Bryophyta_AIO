 * WalkToWildy:
    * starts walking west towards edgeville, then east to hop the line every time

 * Loot:
    * While fighting frogs wanted to loot a coin in lumbridge castle
        * should just not have coins apart of the loot list when fighting rats/frogs

 * EscapePKer
    * insta-logs back in and then sleeps instead of sleeping while logged out
    * log out is also broken - stops the player from running
        * would need a check to know for sure i can log to use this

 * EscapePKer
    * (found online) You should have a thread checking for players near you instead, that will work better

 * EscapePker
    * got attacked by a deadman i think, didn't register skulled

 * AttackMonster
    * was trying to attack a rat... had select to attack it and was running towards it, but was stuck behind something
    * to fix it i had to manually step to a new tile and then start the script again
    * think this happens when leveling up at the perfect time? noticed i increased an hp lvl the second time it happened
        * noticed again increased level
    * FIX: double check healthbar appears if not then click again

 * drinks potion, attacks different monster when orig monster was right next to me still
