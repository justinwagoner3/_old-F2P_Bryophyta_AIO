 * TOP TODOs:
    * double hops wilderness ditch
        * maybe fixed now
    * withdraw all for things like arrows when not in wilderness
    * Bank.openClosest() can be used

 * Randomize walking (maybe use this, but do other research):
{{{
  while (bankLocation.getCenter().distance() > 6) {
            if (Walking.shouldWalk(Calculations.random(2, 7))) {
                Walking.walk(bankLocation.getCenter().getRandomizedTile(1));
                sleep(50, 1500);
            }
        }
}}


 * Turn run on
    * should be it's own Node, not part of attacking a monster

 * EscapePker:
    * will start running away and keep running even if not being attacked anymore

 * Handle death
    * go loot key on the ground if you have a gravestone

 * Buy Gear:
    * Because I died and needed to re-gear, Wanted to buy 300 lobsters even though I had 100+ in the bank

 * Won't loot bones for frogs when too far north

 * Should loot closest item - sometimes walks real far away to pick up bones when there are bones right next to player

 * Fixing static prices
    * `(Inventory.count("item") + Bank.count("item")) * LivePrices.get("item"))` might work

 * TravelToLumBank
    * spam clicks in the bank until bank is in view, should just click once and wait until bank in view

 * Walk:
    * having the walk in a while loop will make it impossible to eat
        * temp fixed by EscapePker eating while running

 * Loot:
    * add a check if inv is full to still pick up stackables
        * itemToPickUp.getItem().isStackable()

 * If running out of potions before food, should stay and fight insteaf of drink potion and run right to bank
 * could randomize even more with global variables that change the min max bounds of random calcs every run
 * add a trade checker
    * had someone randomly trade me gear probably trying to catch bots

 * When attacking a monster, if it goes to loot, should return to attacking same monster
