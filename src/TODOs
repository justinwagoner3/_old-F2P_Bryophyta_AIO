 * TOP TODOs:
    * HopWorlds
    * evade PKer

 * Walk:
    * have to manually enable walking out of enclave right now
    * having the walk in a while loop will make it impossible to eat
 * Loot:
    * add a check if inv is full to still pick up stackables
        * itemToPickUp.getItem().isStackable()
    * could probably just loot everything over a certain getItem.getValue()
 * If running out of potions before food, should stay and fight insteaf of drink potion and run right to bank
 * Make sure f2p world is selected before logging in
 * buy gear:
    * check if i have the item in bank first before buying
    * set activate condition to activate if any of the gear is missing
    * always buy 1st slot, 2nd slot, 1st slot, 2nd slot... need it randomized
 * could randomize even more with global variables that change the min max bounds of random calcs every run
 * could implement a task that checks if in combat, then constantly query the next monster so next attack monsteer happens quicker
 * add a trade checker
    * had someone randomly trade me gear probably trying to catch bots
